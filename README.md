<h2>Open_UoM Assignment 2</h2>
<p>This is a single page attractive website which is developed for petshops. Sellers can showcase the cats and dogs foods and accessories on this site. I've used HTML, CSS and vanila JS for this project. This is a prototype website which is needed to be develop more in future such as user login and admin dashboard.</p>
