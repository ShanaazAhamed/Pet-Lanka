<h2>Open UoM Assignment 2</h2>

<p>This is a single page attractive website which is developed for petshops. User can switch the color-theme as their personal preferences. Sellers can showcase the cats and dogs foods and accessories on this site. There some minimal animation when user hover through the category cards. I've used HTML, CSS and vanila JS for this project. This is a prototype website which is needed to be develop more in future such as user login and admin dashboard.</p>
